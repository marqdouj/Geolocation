# Geolocation Service
- RCL wrapper to the Html Geolocation API
- A demo of this and all of my NuGet packages can be found [here](https://github.com/marqdouj/Blazor-Demos/).

## Release Notes
### 8.8.0
This was a clone of 'BlazorDeviceInterop' [here](https://github.com/darnton/BlazorDeviceInterop).
The GitHub project targets .NET 5.0 and has not been updated since Nov 14, 2021 so I cloned it and updated to .NET 8.0
